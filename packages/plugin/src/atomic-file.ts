/**
 * Atomic replacement of a state file, with the retry Windows needs.
 *
 * On Windows `rename` is `MoveFileEx(..., MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)`, which fails with
 * `EPERM` while another handle holds the *destination* without `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`. The
 * holders are short-lived and outside this process: antivirus and indexer scans, Explorer
 * previews, backup or sync agents, and a second process writing the same state directory.
 * Node always opens with `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` itself, so this process cannot cause it, and
 * the failure disappears on the next attempt - which is why `EPERM` here means "retry",
 * not "permission denied", and why exclusions or packaging changes do not fix it.
 *
 * A retry only hides a second *writer*: two instances sharing one `DSH_HOME` still race on
 * a read-modify-write, so keep parallel Hosts on separate `DSH_HOME` values (see the
 * refresh lock in `server-credentials.ts` for the same rule applied to credentials).
